**Usage:**

```bash
git branch [branch-name]     # Create branch  
git branch -D [branch-name]  # Delete branch
```

Manages independent development workflows.

### 9. `git checkout`

**Usage:**

```bash
git checkout [branch-name]     # Switch to branch  
git checkout -b [branch-name]  # Create and switch
```

git stash -u  
git stash pop
```

Temporarily saves changes without committing (useful when switching branches).

### 12. `git revert`

**Usage:**

```bash
git revert [commit-id]
```

Creates a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit, while preserving history.

## 🔹 Comparing, Merging, and Rebasing

### 13. `git diff`

**Usage:**

```bash
git diff [commit1] [commit2]
```

Shows differences between commits, files, or branches.

### 14. `git merge`

**Usage:**

```bash
git merge [branch-name]
```

Merges changes from one branch into another.

```

Retrieves updates from a remote repository without merging.

### 17. `git reset`

**Usage:**

```bash
git reset --hard [commit-id]
```

Resets the repo to a previous commit, discarding later changes. ⚠️ **Destructive operation.**

### 18. `git pull`

**Usage:**

```bash
git pull origin [branch-name]
```

Fetches and merges updates from the remote repo into the current branch.
